# BM Support Widget
A custom support widget plugin for WordPress that appears as a pop-up on clientsdashboards when they need help.

This is a custom built plugin to serve up a customized Help Scout beacon that we use for our support platform.
Note that the code therefore contains our specific HelpScout implementation.

If you use this as a base for your own custom project this will *need* to be changed.

We release this publically in the spirit of sharing even the smallest project which does not for confidentially reasons have to be private.
